# Binary Operator Testing


## Completion
I was able to implement the arithmetic and multiplcative identaties as well as test for both. I did not have time to implement anything else. The testing was also crude in that I hard coded the paths.


## Learning Experience

This assignment was helpful in that I had never used a test bench like this before. The only test benches I had used were in Verilog but that was a whole different thing. This is actually really cool and I will try to use it in future projects. The fact that there was already existing code and the instructions were pretty vague forced me to learn stuff and figure out the problem myself which is nice because it gives me experience with working on someone else's code.

## The Good and the Bad

I didn't dislike anything, but having self everywhere was confusing because I have not seen code in a while. It took a few more minutes than I would like to admit to figure out that it was just like "this" in other languages. So maybe giving a little more explaination on what the code is doing/what it means would have made starting much easier.


;;> Tests are very sparse, missed some bugs. See code for details. Overall well done though!
